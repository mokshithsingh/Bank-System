# 🏦 Bank System — Version History

---

## 💾 v1.0 – The ATM Era (The Primitive Age)

> “One account. No database. Infinite chaos.”

Designed using problamatic classes and functions and occasional panic.  
Users could deposit, withdraw, and maybe break the system if they sneezed too hard.  
Balance checks were optional, because... Indian ATM realism 🇮🇳  

🧠 **Dev Quote:**  
“At least it worked... sometimes.”

## ⚙️ v2.0 – The OOP Revolution (Structured Sanity)

> “We moved from ATM simulation to actual banking logic.”

Introduced **Account** and **Bank** classes (because civilization evolved).  
Multiple accounts now exist! No more dictatorship banking.  
Cleaner deposit/withdraw methods and proper encapsulation.  
The code is readable, maintainable, and **87% less self-destructive.**  
Still running on `print()`-based UI, but hey — every empire starts small.  

🧠 **Dev Quote:**  
“One runtime error can’t scare me now. I use classes.”
